\section{Radiation Processes in Gamma-ray Astrophysics}
\seclabel{radiation_processes}

Nonthermal radiation observed from astrophysical sources is
typically believed to originate in through synchrotron radiation, \ac{IC}
upscattering, and the
decay of neutral \pion particles.  We will discuss these processes
in \subsecref{synchrotron}, \subsecref{inverse_compton}, and
\subsecref{bremsstrahlung} respectively.

\subsection{Synchrotron}
\subseclabel{synchrotron}

  \figlabel{syncrotron_radiation_spiral}
\end{figure}


The synchrotron radiation processes is observed when charged particles
spiral around magnetic field lines.  This process is illustrated in
\figref{syncrotron_radiation_spiral}.  This emission is discussed
thoroughly in \cite{blumenthal_1970a_bremsstrahlung-synchrotron} and
\cite{rybicki_1979a_radiative-processes}.  In what follows, we adopt
the notation from \cite{houck_2006a_models-nonthermal}.

A charged particle of mass $\mass$ and charge $\charge$ in a magnetic
field of strength \MagneticFieldVector will experience an electromagnetic
force:
\begin{align}
  \dbydt (\gamma m \VelocityVector) = & \frac{q}{c} \cross{\VelocityVector}{\MagneticFieldVector}.
\end{align}
This force will cause a particle to accelerate around the magnetic field
lines, radiating due to maxwell's equations.  The power emitted at a
frequency $\frequency$ by one of these particles is
\begin{equation}
  \eqnlabel{power_emitted_particle_sync}
  \power_\text{emitted}(\frequency) = 
  \frac{\sqrt{3} \charge^3 B \sin\alpha}{\mass \speedoflight^2} F(\frequency/\frequency_c),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the angle between the particle's velocity vector and
the magnetic field vector. Here,
\begin{equation}
  F(x) \equiv x \int_x^\infty K_{\tfrac{5}{3}} (\xi) d\xi,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \eqnlabel{characteristic_freqnecy_synctotron}
\frequency_c = \frac{3q \MagneticField \gamma^2}{4\pi \mass \speedoflight} 
\sin\alpha \equiv \nu_0 \gamma^2 \sin\alpha
\end{equation}

Because power is inversely-proportional to mass, synchrotron radiation
is predominatly from electrons.

Now, we assume a population of particles and compute the total observed
emission. We say that $\ParticleDistribution(\momentum,\alpha)$ is the
number of particles per unit momentum and solid angle with a momentum
$\momentum$ and pitch angle $\alpha$.  We find the total power emitted
by integrating over particle momentum and distribution
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\derivative W}{\derivative\time}=
  \int \derivative \momentum 
  \int \derivative \solidangle
  \power_\text{emitted}(\frequency)
  \ParticleDistribution(\momentum,\alpha)
\end{equation}
If we assume the pitch angles of the particles to be isotropically
distributed and, including \eqnref{power_emitted_particle_sync}, we
find that the number of photons emitted per unit energy and time is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\derivative \ParticleDistribution}{\derivative \omega \derivative \time} =
  \frac{\sqrt{3}q^3 B}{h m_e c^2 \angularfrequency}
  \int \derivative\momentum
  \ParticleDistribution(\momentum)
  R \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0 \gamma^2}\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  R(x) \equiv \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\pi
  \derivative \alpha \sin^2 \alpha
  F\left(\frac{x}{\sin\alpha}\right)
\end{equation}

It is typical in astrophysics to assume a 
a power-law distribution of electrons:
\begin{equation}
\eqnlabel{ElectronPowerLawEnergyDistribution}
  \ParticleDistribution(\momentum) \derivative\momentum = 
  \kappa \momentum^{-\spectralindex} \derivative\momentum.
\end{equation}
For a power-law distribution of photons integrated over
pitch angle, we find the total power emitted to me 
\begin{equation}
\TotalPower(\angularfrequency) \propto \kappa \MagneticField^{(p+1)/2} 
\angularfrequency^{-(p-1)/2}.
\end{equation}
See, \cite{rybicki_1979a_radiative-processes} 
or \cite{longair_2013a_energy-astrophysics} for a full derivation.
This shows that, assuming a power-law electron distribution,
the electron spectral index can be related to the photon spectral
index.

\subsection{\Actitle{IC}}
\subseclabel{inverse_compton}

Normal Compton scattering involves a photon colliding with a free electron
and transferring energy to it. In \ac{IC} scattering, a high-energy 
electron interacts with a low-energy photon imparting energy to it.
This process occurs when highly-energetic electrons interact with
a dense photon field.

The derivation of \Ac{IC} emission requires a quantum
electrodynamical treatment. It was first derived by
\cite{klein_1929a_streuung-strahlung}. In what follows, we follow the
notational convention of \cite{houck_2006a_models-nonthermal}.
We assume a population of relativistic ($\gamma\gg1$) electrons
written as $\ParticleDistribution(\momentum)$ which is contained inside isotropic 
photon distribution with number density $n(\omega_i)$.

The distribution of photons 
emitted by \ac{IC} scatter is
written as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\derivative\ParticleDistribution}{\derivative\omega\derivative\time} = 
  c \int d \omega_i n(\omega_i)
  \int_{p_\text{min}}^\infty  dp
  \ParticleDistribution(p) 
 \KleinNishinaCrossSection(\gamma,\omega_i,\omega)
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the outgoing photon energy written
in units of the electron rest mass energy, $\omega\equiv h\nu/(m_e c^2)$,
and $\KleinNishinaCrossSection$ is the Klein-Nishina cross section:
\begin{equation}
\KleinNishinaCrossSection(\gamma,\omega_i,\omega) = \frac{2\pi r_0^2}{\omega_i \gamma^2}
  \left[
  1 + q - 2q^2 + 2q\ln q + \frac{\tau^2 q^2 (1-q)}{2(1+\tau q)}.
  \right]
\end{equation}
Here,
\begin{equation}
  q \equiv \frac{\omega}{4 \omega_i \gamma (\gamma-\omega)},
\end{equation}
$\tau \equiv 4\omega_i \gamma$, and $r_0 = e^2/(m_e c^2)$ is the classical
electron radius.
The threshold electron Lorentz factor is
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_\text{min} =
  \frac{1}{2} 
  \left(
  \omega + \sqrt{\omega^2 + \frac{\omega}{\omega_i}}
  \right)
\end{equation}

Often, \ac{IC} emission happens when an accelerated power-law distribution
of electrons interacts with a thermal photon distribution
\begin{equation}
  n(\omega_i) = 
  \frac{1}{\pi^2\lambda^3} 
  \frac{\omega_i^2}{e^{\omega_i/\Theta} -1}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda=\hbar/(m_e c)$ and $\Theta=kT/(m_e c^2)$.
Often, the target photon distribution is the \ac{CMB}, with
$T=2.725\unitspace\kelvin$.

\subsection{Bremsstrahlung}
\subseclabel{bremsstrahlung}

Bremsstrahlung radiation is composed of electron-electron and electron-ion
interactions.  In either case, we assume a differential spectrum of
accelerated electrons $\ParticleDistribution_\electron(\energy)$ that
interacts with a target density of electrons (\ElectronDensity) or ions
(\IonDensity).

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\derivative \ParticleDistribution}{\derivative\energy\derivative\time} =
  \ElectronDensity \int \derivative\energy
  \ParticleDistribution_\electron(\energy) \velocity_\electron
  \frac{\derivative\CrossSection_{\electron\electron}}{\derivative\energy} +
  \IonDensity \int \denergy
  \ParticleDistribution_\electron(\energy) \velocity_\electron
  \frac{\derivative\CrossSection_{\electron\AtomicNumber}}{\derivative\energy}
\end{equation}

Here, $\velocity_\electron$ is the velocity of the
electron, and $\CrossSection_{\electron\electron}$ and
$\CrossSection_{\electron\AtomicNumber}$ are the electron-electron
and electron-ion cross sections.  The actual formulas for
$\derivative\CrossSection_{\electron\electron}/\derivative\energy$ and
$\derivative\CrossSection_{\electron\AtomicNumber}/\derivative\energy$
are quite involved.  The electron-electron cross section was worked out
in \cite{haug_1975a_bremsstrahlung-production}.  The electron-ion cross
section is called the Bethe-Heitler cross-section and is worked
out in the Born approximation in \cite{heitler_1954a_quantum-theory}
and \cite{koch_1959a_bremsstrahlung-cross-section}.  A more
accurate relativistic correction to this formula is given in
\cite{haug_1997a_nonrelativistic-bremsstrahlung}.  We refer to
\cite{houck_2006a_models-nonthermal} for a detailed numerical
implementation of these formulas.

\subsection{Pion Decay}

Neutral \pion decay occurs when highly-energetic protons interact with
thermal protons. This emission happens when protons decay into neutral
pions through $pp \processarrow \pion + X$ and the $\pion$ subsequently
decay through $\pion \processarrow 2\gamma$.  The gamma-ray emission
from neutral pion decay can be computed as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\derivative\ParticleDistribution}{\derivative\energy\derivative\time} = 
  \HydrogenDensity \int \denergy \velocity_\proton \ParticleDistribution_\proton(\energy) 
  \frac{\derivative\CrossSection_{\proton\proton}}{\derivative\energy}
\end{equation}
Here, $\ParticleDistribution_\proton(\energy)$
is the differential proton distribution,
$\derivative\CrossSection_{\proton\proton}/\derivative\energy$ is
$\gamma$-ray cross section from proton-proton interactions, and
$\HydrogenDensity$ is the target hydrogen density.  The computation
of $\derivative\CrossSection_{\proton\proton}/\derivative\energy$
is rather involved. Typically, people employ a parameterization
of the calculations performed by
\cite{kamae_2006a_parameterization-gamma}.
