\paperref{This chapter is based the second part of the paper
  ``Constraints on the Galactic Population of TeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae using Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations''
  \citep{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic}.}

In \chapref{extended_search}, we search for new spatially-extended \fermi
sources and found that spatial extension was an important characteristic
for detecting new \acp{PWN}. In the process, we discovered three new
$\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} candidates (\hessj{1616}, \hessj{1632},
\hessj{1837}).  In \chapref{offpeak}, we then searched in the off-peak
phase interval of \ac{LAT}-detected pulsars for new \acp{PWN} and
discovered \threecfiftyeight.  Finally, in \chapref{tevcat} we searched
in the regions surrounding \acp{PWN} candidates detected at \tev energies
for \gev-emitting \acp{PWN} and detected four new \acp{PWN} candidates
(\hessj{1119}, \hessj{1303}, \hessj{1420}, and \hessj{1841}) and 1 new
PWN (\hessj{1356})

In this chapter, we take the population of $\gamma$-ray
emitting \acp{PWN} and \acp{PWN} candidates and study how their
multiwavelength properties evolve with properties of their host pulsars.
In \tabref{pwn_multiwavelenth_properties}, we compile the multiwavelength
properties of the \ac{VHE} sources studied in \chapref{tevcat}. In
particular, we include the spectra of the \acp{PWN} observed at X-ray and \ac{VHE}
energies, and the observed spin-down powers, ages, and distances of the associated
pulsars.

\end{figure}

In \figref{pwn_luminosity_vs_edot}, we compare the observed luminosity at
\gev energies to the spin-down power of the observed pulsar.  This plot
shows that all \ac{LAT}-detected \acp{PWN} emit a fraction $\lesssim
10\%$ of their spin-down energy into the $\gamma$-ray emission from
the \ac{PWN}.

  \caption{The observed $\gamma$-ray luminosities and the
  \gev to \tev luminosity ratios as a function of the ages
  and spin-down energies for the \ac{PWN} candidates 
  from \tabref{pwn_multiwavelenth_properties}.  The dotted line
  corresponds to the average luminosity ratio (\MeanLuminosityRatio).
  Because \hessj{1708} is classified as being a \PSRClass-type
  source in \chapref{tevcat}, we consider the observed $\gamma$-ray
  luminosity of it to be an upper limit on the \ac{PWN} emission.

Next, in \figref{pwn_age_edot_vs_l_gev.pdf} we compare compare the \gev
luminosities and \gev to \tev luminosity ratios as a function of ages
and spin-down energies of the host pulsars.  These plots shows that
there is no correlation between the \gev luminosities or \gev to \tev
luminosity ratios and the ages and spin-down energies of the associate
pulsars.  In addition, we overlay the mean \gev to \tev luminosity ratio
($\MeanLuminosityRatio=2.7_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$).

  \caption{The observed X-ray flux and \gev to \tev luminosity ratios
  as a function of the age and spin-down energies for the \ac{PWN}
  candidates from \tabref{pwn_multiwavelenth_properties}.
  The dotted line corresponds to the scaling relationships from
  \cite{mattana_2009_evolution-gamma-} for the \tev to X-ray
  luminosity ratio scaled by the average \gev to \tev luminosity
  (\MeanLuminosityRatio).  We caution that \threecfiftyeight does not
  have a X-ray luminosity error.}

\end{figure}

Finally, in \figref{pwn_age_edot_vs_l_xray} we compare the distribution
of the X-ray luminosities and the \gev to X-ray luminosity ratios as a
function of the ages and spin-down energies of the pulsars.  This plot
shows that the X-ray luminosity decreases with pulsar age and increases
with spin-down energy. Similarly, the \gev to X-ray luminosity increases
with age and decreases with energy.  These correlations are consistent
with the simple model predicted in \cite{mattana_2009_evolution-gamma-}
(See \secref{pwn_emission}) and also with the observed \ac{VHE}
relationships from the same paper.
