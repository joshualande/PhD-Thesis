We detected 22 sources at \gev energies.  For significantly-detected
sources, we present the spatial and spectral results for these sources
in \tabref{tevcat_spatial_spectral}.  Flux upper limits for non-detected
sources as well as spectral points in three independent energy bins are
can be found in \cite{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic}.

We attempt to classify the \gev emission into four categories:
\PWNClass-type for sources where the \gev emission is clearly identified
as \aac{PWN}, \PWNcClass for sources where the \gev emission could potentially
be due to a \ac{PWN}, \PSRClass-type for sources where the emission is
most likely due to pulsed emission inside the pulsar's magnetosphere,
and \OtherClass-type (for other) when the true nature of emission is
uncertain.

We categorize a source as \PWNClass-type or \PWNcClass-type when the
emission has a hard spectrum which connects spectrally to the \ac{VHE}
spectrum and when there is some multiwavelength evidence that the
\gev and \ac{VHE} emission should be due to a \ac{PWN}.  We label
a source as \PWNClass-type when the \ac{VHE} emission suggests
more strongly that the emission is due to a \ac{PWN}.  We include
in \tabref{tevcat_spatial_spectral} the source classifications
for each source.  We will discuss the \PWNClass-type source
in \subsecref{tevcat_pwn_pwnc_type_sources}.  We label a source
as \PSRClass-type if the emission is soft, point-like, and strongly
effected by our inclusion of its associated \ac{2FGL} pulsar in the
background model.  We label a source as \OtherClass-type otherwise.
