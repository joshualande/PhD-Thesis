Spatial analysis of \fermi data is important in identifying $\gamma$-ray
emitting \acp{PWN}.  In \chapref{extended_analysis}, we developed a new
method to study spatially-extended sources.  In \chapref{extended_search},
we searched for extended \ac{2FGL} sources.  In the process, we analyzed
the $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} \hessj{1825} and \mshfifteenfiftytwo
which had previously been detected.  In addition, we discovered three
additional spatially-extended \fermi sources coincident with \acp{PWN}
candidates (\hessj{1616}, \hessj{1632}, \hessj{1837}).

In \chapref{offpeak}, we then searched for $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
by looking in the off-peak emission of \ac{LAT}-detected pulsars. In
that analysis, we detected four $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} (\velax,
the Crab Nebula, \mshfifteenfiftytwo, and \threecfiftyeight).

In this chapter, we continue the search for $\gamma$-ray emitting
\acp{PWN} by searching for \acp{PWN} which had previously been
detected at \ac{VHE} energies by \acp{IACT}. We note that the work
presented here is a very condensed version of the results presented in
\citep{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic}.  We refer to that publication
for a more detailed discussion of the analysis.
