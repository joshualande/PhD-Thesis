\subsection{\OtherClass-type Sources}

We detected six \OtherClass-type sources.  Two of these sources
(\hessj{1634} and \hessj{1804}) have a hard spectrum which connects
spectrally to the \ac{VHE} emission but are not classified as \ac{PWN}
based upon multiwavelength considerations.  \hessj{1634} is not
a \ac{PWN} candidate because there are no pulsar counterparts able to
power it.  \hessj{1804} was suggested to be \snrg{8.7}
\citep[W30,][]{ajello_2012a_fermi-large}.

The remaining four \OtherClass-type sources have a soft spectrum
which does not connect with the \ac{VHE} emission: \hessj{1018},
\hessj{1507}, \hessj{1834}, and \verj{2016}.  \hessj{1018}
is in the region of the $\gamma$-ray binary \onefglj{1018.6}
\citep{the-fermi-lat-collaboration_2012a_periodic-emission} and also
\snrg{284.3}.  \gev emission from the region of \hessj{1507} is studied
in \cite{domainko_2012a_exploring-nature}.  \hessj{1834} and \verj{2016}
both lack pulsars energetic enough to power the observed emission.
