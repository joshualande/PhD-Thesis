\subsection{\PSRClass-type Sources}

In \citep{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic}, the
$\energy>10\unitspace\gev$ search for \ac{PWN} was performed both
with and without associated pulsars included in the background model.
When we did not include the \ac{LAT}-detected pulsars included in the
background model, we detected nine sources which were consistent with
magnetospheric emission.  After modeling the associated pulsars in the
background, only \hessj{1708} remained significant.  Even so, the source
was strongly influenced by the inclusion of the pulsar in the background
model, so we suspect that the emission primarily magnetospheric and that
our pulsar emission model underpredicts the true magnetospheric emission.
