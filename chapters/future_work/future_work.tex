Since the observation of the Crab Nebula
in \citeyear{weekes_1989a_observation-gamma}
\cite{weekes_1989a_observation-gamma}, we have learned much about the
high-energy \ac{IC} emission from \ac{PWN}. \ac{PWN} The current era of
\ac{VHE} experiments (\ac{HESS}, Magic, and Veritas) has drastically
expanded the population of \ac{PWN} observed to emitt $\gamma$-rays.
\acp{PWN} are now the most populous class of \ac{VHE} sources in the
Galaxy.  Now, using the \ac{LAT} we have detected a large fraction of
these \ac{VHE} \ac{PWN} at \gev energies.

The greatest improvement in our knowlege of \ac{PWN} will most likely come
from \acp{IACT}. The proposed \ac{CTA} \citep{actis_2011a_design-concepts}
will would have a much improved effective area and angular resolution,
allowing for the discovery of more \ac{VHE} \ac{PWN} as well as improved
imaging of \ac{PWN} candidates.

As was the case for \hessj{1825} energy-dependent morphology at \ac{VHE}
energies can be used to unambigous identify \ac{VHE} emission as being
caused by a \ac{PWN} \citep{aharonian_2006a_energy-dependent}.  Similarly,
\cite{van-etten_2011a_multi-zone-modeling} showed for \hessj{1825} that
detailed spatial and spectral observations combined with multi-zone
modeling of a \ac{PWN} can be constraing detailed properties of
the \ac{PWN}.  Detailed energy-dependent imaging of a larger sample
of \ac{PWN} will allow us a greater understanding of the physics of
pulsar winds.

In addition, the Crab nebula has challenged our basic understand of the
physics of \ac{PWN}. It is possible the more detailed observations could
uncover additional variable \ac{PWN}, which could help to shine light
on the nature of the variable emission.

Finally, because of the large density of \ac{PWN}-emitting \ac{VHE}
sources in the galactic plane, it is important to identify \ac{VHE}
\ac{PWN} to help in the search for new source classes.  There is
significant potential for discoveriy of new source classes in the sources
that are not classifed as \ac{PWN}.  If the past is any guide towards
the future, there is much still to be learned about \acp{PWN}.
