\chapter{Population Study of \Acstitle{LAT}-detected \Acsptitle{PWN}}
\chaplabel{population_study}

\paperref{This chapter is based the second part of the paper
  ``Constraints on the Galactic Population of TeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae using Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations''
  by Acero et al which is currently in prep.}

In \chapref{extended_search}, we search for new spatially-extended \fermi
sources and found that spatial extension was an important characteristic
for detecting new \acp{PWN}. In the process, we discovered three new
$\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} candidates (\hessj{1616}, \hessj{1632},
\hessj{1837}).

In \chapref{offpeak}, we then searched in the off-peak phase interval
of \ac{LAT}-detected pulsars for new pulsar wind nebula and discovered
\threecfiftyeight.  Finally, in \chapref{tevcat} we searched in the
regions surrounding \acp{PWN} candidates detected at \tev energies for
\gev-emitting \acp{PWN} 4 new PWNe candidates (\hessj{1119}, \hessj{1303},
\hessj{1420}, and \hessj{1841}) and 1 new PWN (\hessj{1356})

In this chapter, we take the population of $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
and \acp{PWN} candidates and study how their multiwavelength properties
vary with properties of the associated pulsar.

In \tabref{pwn_multiwavelenth_properties}, we compile the multiwavelength
properties of the \ac{VHE} sources studied in \chapref{tevcat}. In
particular, we include the spectrum observed at X-ray and \ac{VHE}
energies, the name of the associated pulsar, and the observed spin-down
power, age, and distance of the pulsar.

\end{figure}

In \figref{pwn_luminosity_vs_edot}, we compare the observed luminosity at
\gev energies to the spin-down power of the observed pulsar.  This plot
shows that all \ac{LAT}-detected \acp{PWN} emit a fraction $\lesssim 10\%$
of their spin-down energy goes into powering the $\gamma$-ray emission
from the pulsar wind.

  \caption{The observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity and the \gev
  to \tev luminosity ratio as a function of the pulsar's age
  and spin-down energy for the \ac{PWN} candidates presented in
  \tabref{pwn_multiwavelenth_properties}.  The dotted line corresponds
  to the average luminosity ratio.  Because \hessj{1708} is classified
  as being a \PSRClass-type source in \chapref{tevcat}, we consider it's
  observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity to be an upper limit on the \ac{PWN}
  emission.  \figlabel{pwn_age_edot_vs_l_gev.pdf}.}
\end{figure}

Next, in \figref{pwn_age_edot_vs_l_gev.pdf} we compare compare \gev
luminosity and \gev to \tev luminosity ratio as a function of age and
spin-down energy.  These plots shows that there is no correlation between
the \gev luminosity and the age and spin-down energy of the associate
pulsar.  In addition, we calculated and overlay the mean between the
\gev and \tev luminosity ($\MeanLuminosityRatio=2.7_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$).

  The dotted line corresponds to the scaling relationships from
  \cite{mattana_2009_evolution-gamma-} for the \tev to X-ray luminosity
  scaled by the average \gev to \tev luminosity (\MeanLuminosityRatio).
  We caution that \threecfiftyeight is not have a X-ray luminosity error.}

Finally, in \figref{pwn_age_edot_vs_l_xray} we compare the distribution
of the X-ray luminosity and the \gev to X-ray luminosity ratio as a
function of the pulsar's age and spin-down energy.  This plot shows
that the X-ray luminosity decreases with pulsar age and increases with
spin-down energy. Similarly, the \gev to X-ray luminosity increases
with age and decreases with energy.  These correlations are consistent
simple model predicted in \cite{mattana_2009_evolution-gamma-} (See
\secref{pwn_emission}) and also with the observed \ac{VHE} relationships
from the same paper.
