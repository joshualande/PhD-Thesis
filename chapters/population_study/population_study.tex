\chapter{Population Study of \Acsptitle{LAT}-detected \Acsptitle{PWN}}
\chapref{population_study}

\paperref{This chapter is based the second part of the the paper
  ``Constraints on the Galactic Population of TeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae using Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations''
  by Acero et al which is currently in prep.}

In \chapref{extended_search}, we search for new spatially-extended \fermi
sources and found that spatial extenion was an important characteristic
for detecting new \acp{PWN}. In the process, we discovered three
new $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}.  

In \chapref{offpeak}, we then
searched in the off-peak phase interval of \ac{LAT}-detected pulsars
for new pulsar wind nebula and discovered \threecfiftyeight.  Finally,
in \chapref{tevcat} we searched in the regions surrounding \acp{PWN}
candidates detected at \tev energies for \gev-emitting \acp{PWN}
4 new PWNe candidates (\hessj{1119}, \hessj{1303}, \hessj{1420},
and \hessj{1841}) and 1 new PWN (\hessj{1356})

In this chapter, we take the population of $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
and \acp{PWN} candidates and study how thier multiwavlenth properties
vary with propergies of the associated pulsar.
