\section{Motivations for Maximum-Likelihood Analysis of Gamma-ray Data}
\seclabel{motivations_maximum_likelihood}

Traditionally, spectral and spatial analysis of astrophysical data
relies on a process known as aperture photometry.  This process is
done by measuring the counts within a given radius of the source and
subtracting from it a background level estimated from a nearby region.
Often, the source's flux is calibrated by measurements of nearby objects
with known fluxes.  Otherwise, the flux can be obtained by dividing the
number of source counts by the telescope's size, the observation time,
and the telescope's conversion efficiency.  The application of this
method to \ac{VHE} data is described in \cite{li_1983_analysis-methods}.

Unfortunately, this simpler analysis method is inadequate for dealing with
the complexities introduced in analyzing LAT data.  Most importantly,
aperture photometry assumed that the background is isotropic so that
the background level can be estimated from nearby regions.  As was
discussed in \subsecref{galactic_diffuse_and_isotropic}, the Galactic
diffuse emission is highly anisotropic, rendering this assumption invalid.

In addition, this method is not optimal due to the high density of sources
detected in the $\gamma$-ray sky.  \Ac{2FGL} reported on the detection
of 1873 sources, which corresponds to an average source spacing of
$\sim5\degree$.  But within the inner $45\degree$ of the galactic plane
in longitude and $0.5\degree$ of the galactic plane in latitude, there
are 73 sources, corresponding to a source density of $\sim 1$ source per
square degree.  The aperture photometry method is unable to effectively
fit multiple sources when the tails of their \acp{PSF} overlap.

Finally, this method is suboptimal due to the large energy range of
\ac{LAT} observations.  A typical spectral analysis studies a source in an
energy from 100 \mev to above 100 \gev.  As was shown
in \secref{fermi_telescope}, the \ac{PSF} of the \ac{LAT} is rather broad ($\gtrsim
1\degree$) at low energy and much narrower ($\sim 0.1\degree$) at higher
energies. Therefore, higher 
energy photons coming from a source are much more sensitive, which
is discarded by simple aperture photometry methods.
