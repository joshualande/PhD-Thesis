\begin{itemize}
  \item Traditonal astrophysical analysis involves an on minus of background estimation.
  \item Analysis of LAT data more complciated due to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Anisotrpic background. See \secref{modeling_background}.
      \item Energy-dependent PSF
      \item High source density, espeically in the Galactic plane.
    \end{itemize}
  \item To avoid issues assocaited with this, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis
  \item Define a model of the sky.
  \item likelihood $L$ is defiend as $L=P(data|model)$, where $L=L(model parameters)$.
  \item Benefits: XXX
\end{itemize}
