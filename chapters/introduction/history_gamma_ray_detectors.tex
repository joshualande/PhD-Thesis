\seclabel{history_gamma_ray_detectors}

It was only natural to wonder about photons with even
higher energies. These higher energy photons must
come from more extreme processes in space.

As is common in the field of physics, the prediction of
the detection of cosmic $\gamma$-rays far proceded their discovery.
\cite{feenberg_1948_interaction-cosmic-ray} theorized that the interaction
of starlight with cosmic rays could produce $\gamma$-rays through
\ac{IC} upscattering.  Following the discovery of the neutral
pion in 1949, \cite{hayakawa_1952_propagation-cosmic}
predicted that $\gamma$-ray emission could be observed from the
decay of neutral pions when cosmic rays interacted with interstellar
matter.  And in the same year, \cite{hutchinson_1952_possible-relation}
discussed the bremsstrahlung radiation of cosmic-ray electrons.
\cite{morrison_1958_gamma-ray-astronomy} first predicted the detection
of several sources of $\gamma$-rays including solar flares, \acp{PWN},
and active galaxies.

Attempts were made in the 1940s and 1950s to determine the
composition of cosmic rays using balloon-based experiments. See,
for example \cite{critchfield_1952_radiation-balloon} and
\cite{hulsizer_1948_search-electrons}.  But the attempt to observe
cosmic $\gamma$-rays was hampered by the strong background of atmospheric
albedo $\gamma$-rays.

The first space-based $\gamma$-ray detector was \explorerxi
\cite{kraushaar_1965_explorer-experiment}.  It was developed at \ac{MIT}
under the direction of William L. Kraushaar.  It employed a sandwich
scintillator and a Cherenkov counter to direct the position and energy
of incoming $\gamma$-rays and was surounded by a plastic anticoincidence
scintilation counter. The sandwich detector operated in the energy
energy range for $E>100\unitspace\mev$.
It had an area of $\sim45\cm^2$
but an effective area of only $\sim 7\cm^2$, corresonding
to a detector efficiency of $\sim 15\%$.

It was launched on boad \explorerxi on April 27,
1961. The instrument was in opreation for 7 months, but only 141 hours
of data were of acceptable quality.  Using these observations, \explorerxi
observed 31 $\gamma$-rays and, because the distribution a distribution of
these $\gamma$-rays was consistent with being isotropic, the experiment
could not firmly identify the $\gamma$-rays as being cosmic in nature.

The first definitive detection of $\gamma$-ray came in
1962 by an experiment on the Ranger 3 moon
probe \citep{arnold_1962_gamma-space}.  It detected an isotropic flux
of $\gamma$-rays in the 0.5 \mev to 2.1 \mev energy range.

\Iac{OSO-3}, also developed by Kraushaar, followed \explorerxi
as the next major astrophysical $\gamma$-ray detector
\cite{kraushaar_1972_high-energy-cosmic}.  \Iac{OSO-3} 
allowed the on board $\gamma$-ray detected to have an improved weight,
power, telemetry, and expsoure, creating a more sensitive experiment.
The experiment operated in the energy range from 50 \mev to $\sim 400$
\mev, had an effective area $\sim 9$ $\cm^2$, and had a angular resolution of
$\sim 24\degree$ at its \ac{FWHM}.

It was launched on March 8, 1967 and operated for 16 months, measuring
621 cosmic $\gamma$-rays.  The most important result of the expirment was
to measure a strong anisotrophy in the distribution of the $\gamma$-rays
with a strong clustering of $\gamma$-rays towards the Galactic plane.
\figref{oso3_skymap} shows a skymap of these $\gamma$-rays.  This
experiment confirmed both a Galactic component to the $\gamma$-ray
sky as well as an additional isotropic component, hypothesised to be
extragalactic in origin.

The major discovery by \iac{OSO-3} was confirmed by a ballon-based
$\gamma$-ray detector in 1970  \citep{kniffen_1970_study-gamma}.  In the
following year, the first $\gamma$-ray pulsar (the Crab) was detected
by another ballon-based detector \cite{browning_1971_detection-pulsed}.

  % ``Additional gamma-ray experiments flew on the OGO, OSO, Vela, and Russian
  % Cosmos series of satellites. However, the first satellite designed as a
  % ``dedicated'' gamma-ray mission was the second Small Astronomy Satellite
  % (SAS-2) in 1972.`` - http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/history_gamma.html

The next major advancement in $\gamma$-ray astronomy came from
the \ac{SAS-2} and \cosb missions.

\ac{SAS-2} was a dedicated $\gamma$-ray detector
launched by \ac{NASA} in November 15, 1972.  \ac{SAS-2} was
\cite{fichtel_1975_high-energy-gamma-ray} It improved upon \iac{OSO-3}
by incorporating a spark chamber and having an overall larger size.
The size of the active area of the detector was 640 $\cm^2$ and the
experiment had a much improved effective area of $\sim 115\unitspace cm^2$. The
spark chamber allowed for a seperate measurement of the electron and
positron tracks, which allowd for improved directional reconstruction
of the incident $\gamma$-ray. \ac{SAS-2} had a PSF $\sim5\degree$ at 30
\mev and $\sim1\degree$ at 1 \gev.

\ac{SAS-2} collected data for over 6 months before a power supply
failure ended data collection. \ac{SAS-2} Observed over 8,000
$\gamma$-ray photons covering $\sim55\%$ of
the sky including most of the Galactic plane.  
\ac{SAS-2} disovered strong emission
along the Galactic plane and particularly towards the Galactic
cente. It also discovered
pulsations from the
Crab \citep{fichtel_1975_high-energy-gamma-ray} and Vela pulsar
\citep{thompson_1977_sas-2-high-energy}.  In addition, \ac{SAS-2}
discovered Geminga, the first $\gamma$-ray source with no compelling
multiwavelenth counterpart \citep{thompson_1977_final-sas-2}. Gemina
was eventually discovered to be a pulsar by \ac{EGRET}
\citep{bertsch_1992_pulsed-high-energy} and retroactivly by \ac{SAS-2}
\citep{mattox_1992_observation-pulsed}.

% ``Cos-B was ESA's first satellite dedicated to a single experiment. Its
% scientific mission was to study in detail the sources of extra-terrestrial
% gamma radiation at energies above about 30 MeV. The originally foreseen
% duration of the mission was two years, but in fact Cos-B functioned

on August 9, 1975, \ac{ESA} launched \cosb, a $\gamma$-ray 
detector similar to \ac{SAS-2}. 
\cosb included a spark chamber but
improved upon the design of
\ac{SAS-2} by including a calorimiter below the spark chamber
which improved the energy resolution to $<100\%$ for energies $\sim
3\unitspace\gev$ \citep{bignami_1975_cos-b-experiment}.
\cosb has a comparable effective area to \ac{SAS-2}:
$\sim 50\unitspace\cm^2$ at $\sim400\unitspace\mev$
\citep{bignami_1975_cos-b-experiment}.  

\todo[inline]{Over what energy range did \cosb observe photons?}

\cosb operated successfully for over 6 years and produced the first
detailed catalog of the $\gamma$-ray sky.  In total, \cosb observed $\sim
80,000$ photons \cite{mayer-hasselwander_1982_large-scale-distribution}.
\ac{2CG} detailed
the detection 25 $\gamma$-ray sources for $E>100\unitspace\mev$
\citep{swanenburg_1981_second-catalog}.  \figref{cos_b_skymap}
shows a map of these sources.  Of these sources, the vast majority
lay along the galactic plane and could not be positivly identified
with sources observed at other wavelenths.  In addition, \cosb
observed the first ever extragalactic $\gamma$-ray source,
\citep[3C273,][]{swanenburg_1978_observation-high-energy}.
