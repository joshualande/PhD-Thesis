\section{The History of Gamma-ray Astrophysics}
\seclabel{history_gamma_ray_detectors}

It was only natural to wonder about photons with even
higher energies. 
As is common in the field of physics, the prediction of
the detection of cosmic $\gamma$-rays proceeded their discovery.
\cite{feenberg_1948_interaction-cosmic-ray} theorized that the interaction
of starlight with cosmic rays could produce $\gamma$-rays through
\ac{IC} upscattering.  Following the discovery of the neutral
pion in 1949, \cite{hayakawa_1952_propagation-cosmic}
predicted that $\gamma$-ray emission could be observed from the
decay of neutral pions when cosmic rays interacted with interstellar
matter.  And in the same year, \cite{hutchinson_1952_possible-relation}
discussed the bremsstrahlung radiation of cosmic-ray electrons.
\cite{morrison_1958_gamma-ray-astronomy} predicted the detectability
of $\gamma$-ray emission from solar flares, \acp{PWN}, and active galaxies.

The first space-based $\gamma$-ray detector was \explorerxi
\citep{kraushaar_1965_explorer-experiment}.  
\explorerxi operated in the energy energy range above $100\unitspace\mev$.
It had an area of $\sim45\cm^2$ but an effective area of only $\sim
7\cm^2$, corresponding to a detector efficiency of $\sim 15\%$.

It was launched on board \explorerxi on April 27, 1961. The instrument
was in operation for 7 months, but only 141 hours of data were of
acceptable quality.  Using these observations, \explorerxi observed
31 $\gamma$-rays and, because the distribution a distribution of these
$\gamma$-rays was consistent with being isotropic, the experiment could
not firmly identify the $\gamma$-rays as being cosmic in nature.

The first definitive detection of $\gamma$-ray came in
1962 by an experiment on the Ranger 3 moon
probe \citep{arnold_1962_gamma-space}.  It detected an isotropic flux
of $\gamma$-rays in the 0.5 \mev to 2.1 \mev energy range.

\Ac{OSO-3}, also developed by Kraushaar, 
was the next major astrophysical $\gamma$-ray detector
\citep{kraushaar_1972_high-energy-cosmic}.  \Ac{OSO-3} 
allowed the on board $\gamma$-ray detected to have an improved weight,
power, telemetry, and exposure, creating a more sensitive experiment.
The experiment operated in the energy range from 50 \mev to $\sim 400$
\mev, had an effective area $\sim 9$ $\cm^2$, and had a angular resolution of
$\sim 24\degree$ at its \ac{FWHM}.

\Ac{OSO-3} was launched on March 8, 1967 and operated for 16 months, measuring
621 cosmic $\gamma$-rays.  The most important result of the experiment was
to measure a strong anisotropy in the distribution of the $\gamma$-rays
with a strong clustering of $\gamma$-rays towards the Galactic plane.
\figref{oso3_skymap} shows a sky map of these $\gamma$-rays.  This
experiment confirmed both a Galactic component to the $\gamma$-ray
sky as well as an additional isotropic component, hypothesised to be
extragalactic in origin.

\end{figure}



The major discovery by \ac{OSO-3} was confirmed by a balloon-based
$\gamma$-ray detector in 1970  \citep{kniffen_1970_study-gamma}.  In the
following year, the first $\gamma$-ray pulsar (the Crab) was detected
by another balloon-based detector \cite{browning_1971_detection-pulsed}.

The next major advancement in $\gamma$-ray astronomy came
\ac{SAS-2} and \cosb.  \Ac{SAS-2} was a dedicated $\gamma$-ray
detector launched by \ac{NASA} in November 15, 1972.  \ac{SAS-2} was
\cite{fichtel_1975_high-energy-gamma-ray} It improved upon \ac{OSO-3}
by incorporating a spark chamber and having an overall larger size.
The size of the active area of the detector was 640 $\cm^2$ and the
experiment had a much improved effective area of $\sim 115\unitspace
cm^2$. The spark chamber allowed for a separate measurement of the
electron and positron tracks, which allowed for improved directional
reconstruction of the incident $\gamma$-ray. \Ac{SAS-2} had a PSF
$\sim5\degree$ at 30 \mev and $\sim1\degree$ at 1 \gev.

\Ac{SAS-2} collected data for over 6 months before a power supply failure
ended data collection. \Ac{SAS-2} Observed over 8,000 $\gamma$-ray photons
covering $\sim55\%$ of the sky including most of the Galactic plane.
\Ac{SAS-2} discovered strong emission along the Galactic plane and
particularly towards the Galactic center. It also discovered pulsations
from the Crab \citep{fichtel_1975_high-energy-gamma-ray} and Vela
pulsar \citep{thompson_1977_sas-2-high-energy}.  In addition, \ac{SAS-2}
discovered Geminga, the first $\gamma$-ray source with no compelling
multiwavelength counterpart \citep{thompson_1977_final-sas-2}. Geminga
was eventually discovered to be a pulsar by \ac{EGRET}
\citep{bertsch_1992_pulsed-high-energy} and retroactively by \ac{SAS-2}
\citep{mattox_1992_observation-pulsed}.

On August 9, 1975, \ac{ESA} launched \cosb, a $\gamma$-ray detector
similar to \ac{SAS-2}.  \cosb included a spark chamber but improved upon
the design of \ac{SAS-2} by including a calorimeter below the spark
chamber which improved the energy resolution to $<100\%$ for energies
$\sim 3\unitspace\gev$ \citep{bignami_1975_cos-b-experiment}.  \cosb has
a comparable effective area to \ac{SAS-2}: $\sim 50\unitspace\cm^2$
at $\sim400\unitspace\mev$ \citep{bignami_1975_cos-b-experiment}.

\cosb operated successfully for over 6 years and produced the first
detailed catalog of the $\gamma$-ray sky.  In total, \cosb observed $\sim
80,000$ photons \cite{mayer-hasselwander_1982_large-scale-distribution}.
\Ac{2CG} detailed the detection 25 $\gamma$-ray sources for
$E>100\unitspace\mev$ \citep{swanenburg_1981_second-catalog}.
\figref{cos_b_skymap} shows a map of these sources.  Of these sources,
the vast majority lay along the galactic plane and could not be positively
identified with sources observed at other wavelengths.  In addition,
\cosb observed the first ever extragalactic $\gamma$-ray source,
\citep[3C273,][]{swanenburg_1978_observation-high-energy}.

The next major $\gamma$-ray experiment was \ac{EGRET}.  It was launched
on board \ac{CGRO} in April , 1991.  \ac{CGRO} was second of the Great
Observatories satellites launched by \acp{NASA}.  \ac{EGRET} had a design
similar to \ac{SAS-2}, but had an expanded energy range, operating from
$20\unitspace\mev$ to $30\unitspace\gev$, an improved effective area of
$\sim1500\unitspace\cm^2$ from $\sim500\mev$ to $\sim1\unitspace\gev$,
and an improved angular resolution, decreasing to $\sim0.5\degree$
at its highest energies \cite{thompson_1993a_calibration-energetic}.

\end{figure}

At the time, \ac{CGRO} was the heaviest astrophysical experiment
launched into orbit, weighting $\sim17,000\unitspace\kg$. \ac{EGRET}
contributed $\sim6,000\unitspace\kg$ to the mass of \ac{CGRO}.
\figref{egret_detector} shows a schematic diagram of \ac{EGRET}.

\ac{EGRET} vastly expanded the field of $\gamma$-ray astronomy.
\ac{EGRET} detected six pulsars \citep{nolan_1996a_egret-observations} and
also the Crab Nebula \cite{nolan_1993a_observations-pulsar}.  \ac{EGRET}
also detected the LMC, the first normal galaxy outside of our galaxy to
be detected at $\gamma$-rays \citep{sreekumar_1992a_observations-large}.
\ac{EGRET} also detected Centarus A, the first radio galaxy detected
at $\gamma$-rays \cite{sreekumar_1999a_emission-nearby}.  In total,
EGRET detected 271 $\gamma$-ray sources using 4 years.  The results were
presented in \ac{3EG} \citep{hartman_1999a_third-egret}. This catalog
included 66 high confidence blazar identifications and 27 low-confidence
AGN identifications. \figref{third_egret_catalog_sources} plots the
position of the sources observed by \ac{EGRET}.

\ac{EGRET} was designed with a 2 year mission lifetime, but
operated for 9 years.  Over time, the performance of \ac{EGRET}
degraded due to hardware failure and due to having to replenish gas
in the spark chamber \cite{esposito_1999a_in-flight-calibration}.
In total, \ac{EGRET} detected over 1,500,000 celestial gamma rays
\citep{thompson_2008a_gamma-astrophysics:}.

Following \ac{EGRET}, the next two major $\gamma$-ray observatories
were \ac{AGILE} \citep{pittori_2003a_gamma-ray-imaging}
and \fermi \citep{atwood_2009a_large-telescope}.  \ac{AGILE}
was an \ac{ASI} experiment launched in 2007 and \fermi was
a joint \ac{NASA} and \ac{DOE} experiment which was launched
in 2008.  The major difference between \ac{AGILE} and \fermi
was that \fermi has a significantly-improved effective area
\citep[$9,500\unitspace\cm^2$,][]{atwood_2009a_large-telescope}
compared to \ac{AGILE}
\citep[$\sim500\unitspace\cm^2$,][]{pittori_2003a_gamma-ray-imaging}.
We will discuss the \fermi detector in \secref{fermi_telescope}.
