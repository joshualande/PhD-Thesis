the \fermi Gamma-ray Space telescope was launched on June 11, 2008 on
a Delta II Heavy laucnh vehicle \citep{atwood_2009a_large-telescope}.
The primary since instrument on board \fermi is the \ac{LAT},
which is a pair-conversion telescope which detects $\gamma$-rays in
the energy range from $20\unitspace\mev$ to $>300\unitspace\gev$.
\figref{lat_detector_cutout} shows a schematic diagram of the \ac{LAT}.


With its $2.4\unitspace\steradian$ filed of view,


is a pair-conversion detector which measures
