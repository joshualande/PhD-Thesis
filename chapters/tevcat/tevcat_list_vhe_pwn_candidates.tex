\section{List of \ac{VHE} \Acstitle{PWN} Candidates}
\seclabel{tevcat_list_vhe_pwn_candidates}

We took all sources detected at \ac{VHE} energies and potentially
associated with \acp{PWN} and performed a search at \gev energies for
$\gamma$-ray emission. As was seen in previous chapters, many \acp{PWN}
have been detected both at \gev and \ac{VHE} energies, we suspect that
we might find new $\gamma$-ray emitting \ac{PWN} by searching \ac{LAT}
data in the regions of \ac{VHE} \acp{PWN}.

In addition, there are several \acp{PWN} which have been detected at
\ac{VHE} energies which do not have associated $\gamma$-ray pulsars
(such as \hessj{1825} and \hessj{1837}).  We therefore suspected that
this search could find new $\gamma$-ray emitting \ac{PWN} which were
not previously discovered either in the off-peak search discussed in
\chapref{offpeak} or in another dedicated analyses.

We used \tevcat\footnote{\tevcat can be found at
\url{http://tevcat.uchicago.edu}.} to define our list of \ac{VHE}
sources.  \tevcat is a catalog of sources detected at \ac{VHE} energies by
\acp{IACT}. We selected all sources from this catalog where the emission
was classified as being due to a \ac{PWN}. In addition, we included
all \ac{UNID} sources within 5\degree of the galactic plane since they
could be due to a \ac{PWN}.  Finally, we included \hessj{1023} because,
although this source is classified as a massive star cluster in the
\tevcat, \cite{de-naurois_2013a_galactic-h.e.s.s.} suggested that the
emission could originate in a \ac{PWN}.  \tabref{TeV_sources} presents
a list of all sources included in our analysis
