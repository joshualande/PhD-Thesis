TODO:

In \chapref{extended_search}, we searched for spatially-extended sources
in the 2FGL catalog.  This search showed that the spatial analysis of
\fermi sources is important in identifying $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}.
In that work, we analyzed the $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} \hess{J1825}
and \mshfifteenfiftytwo which had previously been detected in \ac{2FGL}.
In addition, this analysis discovered that there were three additional
spatially-extended \fermi sources coincident with \acp{PWN} candidates
(\hess{J1616}, \hess{J1632}, \hess{J1837}).

In \chapref{offpeak}, we then searched for $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
by looking in the off-peak emission of \ac{LAT}-detected
pulsars. In that analysis, we detected four $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
(\velax, the Crab Nebula, \mshfifteenfiftytwo, and \threecfiftyeight).

In this chapter, we continue our search for $\gamma$-ray emitting
\acp{PWN} by searching for \acp{PWN} which had previously been detected
at \ac{VHE} energies by \acp{IACT}. We note that the work presented here is a
very condensed version of the results presented in the accompanying work
\citep{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic}.  We refer to that publication
for a more detailed discussion of the analysis.

\section{Introduction}

We took all sources detected at \ac{VHE} energies and potentially associated
with \acp{PWN} and performed a search at \gev energies for $\gamma$-ray
emission. As was seen in previous chapters, many \acp{PWN} have been
detected both at \gev and \ac{VHE} energies. Therefore, we suspect that by
searching \ac{LAT} data in the regiongs of \ac{VHE} \acp{PWN} might yield
the discovery of new LAT-detecting \ac{PWN}.

In addition, there are several \ac{PWN} which have been detected at \ac{VHE}
energies which do not have an associated $\gamma$-ray pulsar (such as
\hess{J1825} and \hess{J1837}).  We therefore suspect that this search
strategy may discovery new \ac{PWN} which were not previously discovered
either in the off-peak search discussed in \chapref{offpeak} or in other
dedicated analyses.

\section{List of \ac{VHE} \Acstitle{PWN} Candidates}

\input{chapters/tevcat/tables/list_tev_sources}

We used \tevcat to define the our target list of \ac{VHE} sources.
\tevcat is a catalog of sources detected at
\ac{VHE} energies by \acp{IACT}.\footnote{\tevcat can be found at
\url{http://tevcat.uchicago.edu}.}  We selected all sources from
this catalog where the emission was classified as being due to a
\ac{PWN}. In addition, we included all \ac{UNID} sources within
5\degree of the galactic plane since they could be due to a \ac{PWN}.  Finally,
we included \hess{J1023}. Although this source is classified as a massive
star cluster in the \tevcat, 
\cite{de-naurois_2013a_galactic-h.e.s.s.}
suggested that the emission could be due to \ac{PWN}. The list of all sources
included in our analysis as well as their classification in \tevcat can
be found in \tabref{TeV_sources}.

\section{Analysis Method}
\seclabel{tevcat_analysis_method}

In this search, our analysis method was very similar to the analysis
in \chapref{offpeak}. We used the same hybrid \pointlike/\gtlike
approach for studying the spatial and spectral character of each source
and modeled the region using the same standard background models.

The major difference was that this analysis
was performed only for $\energy>10\unitspace\gev$.  As can be seen in
\chapref{offpeak}, for energies much lower than $10\unitspace\gev$,
source analysis becomes strongly influenced by Galactic-diffuse
emission and systematic errors associated with incorrectly modeling
the emission. On the other hand, the $\gamma$-ray emission from \ac{PWN}
is expected to be the rising component of an \ac{IC} peak which falls
at \ac{VHE} energies. Therefore, the emission observed by the \ac{LAT} is
expected to be hard and most significant at higher energies. Therefore,
we expect that starting the analysis  at $10\unitspace\gev$ will
significantly reduce systematics associated with this analysis while
preserving most of the space for discovery.

Because the analysis was performed only in this high energy range where
the \ac{PSF} of the \ac{LAT} is much improved, we were able to use
a smaller region of interest (a radius of $5\degree$ in \pointlike 
and a square of size $7\degree\times7\degree$ in \gtlike).

Another differences is that we used an event class with less background
contamination (Pass 7 Clean instead of Pass 7 Source) and modeled
nearby background sources using \ac{1FHL} \citep{ackermann_2013a_first-fermi-lat}.

For our analysis, we assume the \gev emission to have a power-law spectral
model and to have whatever was the publisehd spatial model observed at
\ac{VHE} energies.  We define \tstev as the likelihood-ratio test for the
significance of the source assuming it to have the power-law spectral
model and the published \ac{VHE} spatial model.  We claim a detection
when $\tstev > 16$.  Our significance test has only two degrees of freedom:
the flux and spectral index.  Therefore, following Wilk's Theorem (see
\subsecref{monte_carlo_validation}), this corresponds to a $3.6\sigma$
detection threshold. When the source is significantly-detected, we quote
the best-fit spectral parameters and otherwise we derive a upper limit
on the flux of any potential emission.

We note that \cite{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic} performs a more
detailed morphological analysis which also fits the positions of the
sources assuming their emissions to be point-like and spatially-extended.
That work then uses \tsext (See \subsecref{extension_fitting}) to test
if the emission is spatially-extended and otherwise computes an upper
limit on any potential spatial extension.  The more detailed analysis in
\cite{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic} is needed to compare the spatial
overlap between the \gev and \ac{VHE} emission. But for brevity, we omit the
details and simply use the results.

We note that many of these \acp{PWN} candidates are
in regions with \ac{LAT}-detected pulars.  For these sources,
\cite{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic} presents the spectral and
spatial results both with and without the \ac{LAT}-detected pulsar in the
background model. For the analysis, the spectrum of these soruces of thse
background pulsars was taken from the \ac{2FGL} catalog.  For simplicity,
we present only the analysis with the pulsar included in the background
model. This analysis presents our best-guess at the true spectrum of
any \ac{PWN} emission.  But we caution that this method could be biased
in either oversubtracting or undersubtracting the pulsar depending upon
systematics in the fit of the pulsar.

There are three major sources of systematic uncertainty
effect the spectrum of these sources. The first systematic
is due to uncertainty in our modeling of the Galactic diffuse
emission.  We estiamte this uncertainty following the method of
\secref{systematic_errors_on_extension}.  The second systematic is due
to uncertainty in the effective area.  We estimated the systematic
using the method described in \cite{ackermann_2012a_fermi-large}.
The final systematic is due to our uncertainty in the true morphology of
of the source. We used as our systematic error on this the difference
in spectrum when the source is fit assuming the published \ac{VHE} spatial
model and when using the spatial model measured by the LAT.

\section{Sources Detected}
\seclabel{tevcat_sources_detected}

We detect 22 statistically-significant sources. 
We present the spatial and spectral results for these sources in
\tabref{tevcat_spatial_spectral}.

We attempt to classify the \gev emission into four categories.
A source is categories as ``PWN'' and ``PWNc'' when the emission
is hard and connects to the \ac{VHE} spectrum.

which is when the emission can be clearly
identified as being due to a \ac{PWN}.

The second category is ``PWNc''\ldots

The third category is ``PSR''\ldots

The final category is ``O''\ldots

TODO, mention how modeling pulsar in background could be somewaht biased.

\todo[inline]{WHERE ARE RESULTS PRESENTED}. We don't quote upper limits, for some reason\ldots.

Mention that \cite{acero_2013a_constraints-galactic} has a better discussion of the sources
detected.
