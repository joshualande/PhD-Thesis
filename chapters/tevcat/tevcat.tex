\chapter{Search for \Acsptitle{PWN} associated with TeV Pulsars}

\paperref{This chapter is based the first part of the the paper
  ``Constraints on the Galactic Population of TeV Pulsar Wind Nebulae using Fermi Large Area Telescope Observations''
  by Acero et al which is currently in prep.}

In \chapref{extended_search}, we searched for spatially-extended sources
in the 2FGL catalog.  This search showed that the spatial analysis of
\fermi sources is important in identifying $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}.
In this work, we analyzed the $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN} \hess{J1825}
and \mshfifteenfiftytwo which had previously been detected in \ac{2FGL}.
In addition, this analysis discovered that there were three additional
spatially-extended \fermi soruces coincident with \acp{PWN} candidates
(\hess{J1616}, \hess{J1632}, \hess{J1837}).
In \chapref{offpeak}, we then searched for $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
by looking in the off-peak emission of \ac{LAT}-detected
pulsars. In this analysis, we detected four $\gamma$-ray emitting \acp{PWN}
candidates (\velax, the Crab Nebula, \mshfifteenfiftytwo, and \threecfiftyeight).

In this chapter, we followup the search by searching for $\gamma$-ray
emitting \acp{PWN} which has previously been detected at \tev energies
by \acp{ACT}.
